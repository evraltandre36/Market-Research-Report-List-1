<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bone Wax Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Bone Wax</li><li>Non-absorbable Bone Wax</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Bone Wax market is primarily divided into two types: absorbable and non-absorbable bone wax. Absorbable bone wax is designed to dissolve over time, reducing the need for surgical removal and minimizing long-term complications. Non-absorbable bone wax, on the other hand, remains in the body indefinitely, providing immediate hemostatic effects but potentially leading to future complications. Both types serve critical roles in orthopedic and neurosurgical procedures, helping to control bleeding and facilitate healing in bone-related surgeries.</p></p>
