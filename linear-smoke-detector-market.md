<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Linear Smoke Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reflective</li><li>End to End</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Linear smoke detectors are classified into two main types: reflective and end-to-end. Reflective systems use a single unit where emitted smoke reflects off a surface back to the sensor, allowing for detection over a wide area. End-to-end systems consist of two separate units: a light transmitter and a receiver positioned at opposite ends of a space. Smoke moving between them interrupts the light signal, triggering an alarm. Both types are effective for large or open spaces, enhancing fire safety.</p></p>
