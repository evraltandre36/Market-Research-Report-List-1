<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hypercalcemia Treatment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bisphosphonates</li><li>Glucocorticoids</li><li>Calcimimetic Agents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hypercalcemia treatment market includes several key types of therapies. Bisphosphonates help reduce calcium levels by inhibiting bone resorption, making them effective for conditions like malignancy-related hypercalcemia. Glucocorticoids, such as corticosteroids, work by decreasing intestinal absorption and renal reabsorption of calcium. Calcimimetic agents enhance the sensitivity of calcium-sensing receptors, effectively lowering parathyroid hormone secretion, which in turn reduces serum calcium levels. Each treatment type addresses hypercalcemia through different mechanisms, catering to various underlying causes.</p></p>
